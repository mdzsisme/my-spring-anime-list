# my-spring-anime-list
I'm just bored, creating my simple anime list website to make it easier for me to track information on released anime episodes. I'm adding release dates next to the episodes so I know how far along the episodes of the anime I'm currently following have progressed.
And also, I'm including links to watch/download each anime episode alongside.

Here is the link
